                    any obligation limitation for the fiscal year.

                (2) Ratio.--Funds shall be distributed under paragraph (1) 

            in the same ratio as the distribution of obligation authority 

            under subsection (c)(6).

                (1) In general.--The Secretary shall conduct a study with 

            respect to truck sizes and weights in accordance with this 

            section.

                (2) Scope.--In conducting the study, the Secretary shall 

            examine, in accordance with paragraph (3), the effect on 

            principal arterial routes and National Highway System 

            intermodal connectors that allowing nationwide operation of 

            each covered truck configuration would have.

                (3) Contents.--In conducting the study, the Secretary 

            shall--

                        (A) evaluate the effect on safety that allowing 

                    each covered truck configuration to operate would have, 

                    with consideration given to--

                                (i) vehicle operating characteristics under 

                            various conditions likely to be experienced 

                            during commercial operation;

                                (ii) changes in vehicle miles traveled due 

                            to increased vehicle hauling capacity;

                                (iii) shifts in freight between

                            modes to principal arterial routes and National 

                            Highway System intermodal connectors if each 

                            covered truck configuration is allowed to 

                            operate and the effect that any such diversion 

                            would have on other modes of transportation;

                                (ii) the effect that any such diversion 

                            would have on public safety, infrastructure, 

                            cost responsibility, fuel efficiency, and the 

                            environment;

                                (iii) the effect on the transportation 

                            network of the United States that allowing each 

                            covered truck configuration to operate would 

                            have; and

                                (iv) whether allowing each covered truck 

                            configuration to operate would result in an 

                            increase or decrease in the total number of 

                            trucks operating on principal arterial routes 

                            and National Highway System intermodal 

                            connectors; and

            or transportation improvement program is required to be updated 

            not more than once every 4 years;

                (2) an amendment to a long-range transportation plan or 

            transportation improvement program does not require a review of 

            the entire financial plan, but rather requires only a plan for 

            covering any incremental costs associated with the amendment;

                (3) project costs and revenue estimates used in developing 

            a financial plan for a long-range plan should be based on long-

            bonding, or other measures to increase revenues; and

            Secretary the authority or responsibility to determine the 

            adequacy of a State or metropolitan area's funding levels for 

            operation and maintenance of the transportation system.

                                (iii) Limitation on statutory 

                            construction.--Nothing in this subsection or in 

                            the regulations issued pursuant to this 

                            subsection may be construed as indicating an 

                            intention by Congress to affect, change, or 

                            modify in any way the liability, if any, of a 

                            motorcoach manufacturer or motorcoach owner or 

                            operator under applicable law to buses or 

                            motorcoaches, manufactured and operated with or 

                            without passenger seat belts or other passenger 

                            restraint systems, prior to the effective date 

                            of the regulations issued under this 

                            subsection.

                (2) Safety standards for existing motorcoaches.--

                    for motorcoaches that are manufactured before the date 

                    that is 3 years after the date on which the standards 

                    required under paragraph (1) are issued, taking into 

                    account the limitations posed by the need to retrofit 

                    existing motorcoaches. Such standards shall have the 

                    same objectives as the standards required under 

                    subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1), but may 

                    differ from such standards based on what is technically 

                    feasible for existing motorcoaches. Such standards are 

                    technically feasible if the equipment can be certified 

                    by the original equipment manufacturer as meeting 

                    requisite performance requirements and if the equipment 

                    is readily attachable subsequent to initial manufacture 

                    by the operator and enforced through readily visible 

                    inspection requiring no disassembly.

                        (B) Standards for component parts and equipment.--

                    In lieu of issuing comprehensive standards for 

                    motorcoaches under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may 

                    develop standards for various component parts and 

                    equipment of motorcoaches that would increase occupant 

                    protection.

                        (C) Effective date.--The effective date for the 

                    standards issued under this subsection shall be the 

                    same as the effective date for the standards issued 

                    under paragraph (1).

                        (D) Certification.--The Secretary shall establish, 

                    by regulation, a system whereby the motorcoaches to 

                    which the standards issued under subparagraph (A) apply 

                    shall be certified as in compliance with such 

                    standards. Such certification shall be carried out by 

                    the Secretary or by private parties at the discretion 

                    and authorization of the Secretary.

                (3) Compliance timetables.--

                        (A) Effective date.--The effective date of the 

                    standards issued under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be 

                    3 years after the date on which such final standards 

                    are issued. All motorcoaches manufactured after such 

                    date shall comply with such standards.

                        (B) Phased in requirements.--

                                (i) First phase.--Not later than 6 years

                            or operator is shown not to be in compliance 

                            with the timetables set forth in subparagraphs 

                            (A) and (B).

                                (ii) Preemption.--Notwithstanding any 

                            provision of chapter 301 of title 49, United 

                            States Code, a State or a political subdivision

        (c) Additional Considerations.--If the Secretary issues regulations 

    described in subsection (a), the Secretary, in issuing the regulations, 

    shall--

                (1) evaluate the ability of electronic logging device 

            technologies that meet the performance standards described in 

            subsection (b)--

                        (A) to record accurately the time an individual 

                    operating a commercial motor vehicle spends on duty but 

                    not driving, including time spent loading and 

                    unloading; and

                        (B) to ensure all time on duty is accounted for and 

                    cannot be altered or otherwise tampered with by the 

                    operator or motor carrier;

                (2) reduce or eliminate requirements for drivers and motor 

            carriers to retain supporting documentation associated with

                        (A) data contained in an electronic logging device 

                    supplants such documentation; and

                        (B) using such data without paper-based records 

                    does not diminish the Secretary's ability to audit and 

                    review compliance with the Secretary's hours of service 

                    regulations;

                (3) include such measures as the Secretary determines are 

            necessary to protect the privacy of individuals whose personal 

            information is contained in an electronic logging device;

                (4) include such measures as are necessary to ensure that 

            any information collected by the electronic logging device is 

            used by enforcement personnel only for the purpose of 

            determining compliance with hours-of-service requirements and 

            is stored no longer than necessary under the rules; and

                (5) include such measures as are necessary to prohibit 

            public access to data collected by electronic logging devices.

        (d) Use of Data.--

                (1) In general.--The Secretary may utilize information 

            contained in an electronic logging device only to enforce the 

            Secretary's motor carrier safety and related regulations, 

            including record-of-duty status regulations.

                (2) Measures to preserve confidentiality of personal 

            data.--The Secretary shall institute appropriate measures to 

            preserve the confidentiality of any personal data contained in 

            an electronic logging device and disclosed in the course of 

            actions taken by the Secretary or law enforcement officials to 

            enforce the regulations referred to in paragraph (1).

        (e) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:

                (1) Commercial motor vehicle.--The term ``commercial motor 

            vehicle'' has the meaning given that term in section 31132 of 

            title 49, United States Code.

                (2) Electronic logging device.--The term ``electronic 

            logging device'' means an electronic device that acquires and 

            stores data showing the record of duty status of the vehicle 

            operator.

                (3) Tamperproof.--The term ``tamperproof'' means to not 

            allow any individual to cause an electronic device to record 

            the incorrect duty status of a commercial motor vehicle 

            operator under part 395 of title 49, Code of Federal 

            Regulations, or to subsequently alter the record created by 

            that device.

    completion of the environmental reviews for any rail project that may 

    use the right-of-way and the real property interests if the acquisition 

    is otherwise permitted under Federal law. The Secretary may establish 

    restrictions on such an acquisition as the Secretary determines to be 

    necessary and appropriate.

    environmental assessment process or the preparation of environmental 

    impact statements under the standards promulgated by the Council on 

    Environmental Quality (40 C.F.R. 1508.4), if such rail project--

            track and bridge structures; electrification, communication, 

            signaling, or security facilities; stations; maintenance-of-way

            not require the acquisition of a significant amount of right-

            of-way.

        ``(b) Additional Actions.--If a rail project qualifies for 

    categorical exclusion under this section except for additional actions 

    that do not fit in the relevant category, the rail project may be 

    categorically excluded if the Secretary determines, based on 

    information provided by the project sponsor, that the additional 

    actions meet the standards for categorical exclusion promulgated by the 

    Council on Environmental Quality (40 C.F.R. 1508.4).

        ``(c) Other Operating Administrations' Categorical Exclusions.--If 

    a rail project would be eligible for categorical exclusion from the 

    requirements relating to the environmental assessment process or the 

    preparation of environmental impact statements by another operating 

    administration of the Department of Transportation, the Federal 

    Railroad Administration may categorically exclude the rail project.

    SEC. 8703. DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES.

    

        (a) Availability of Funds.--Except to the extent that the Secretary 

    determines otherwise, not less than 10 percent of the amounts made 

    available for any capital grant program under the jurisdiction of the 

    Federal Railroad Administration shall be expended through small

    disadvantaged individuals.

        (b) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:

                (1) Small business concern.--The term ``small business 

            concern'' has the meaning that term has under section 3 of the 

            Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632), except that the term shall 

            not include any concern or group of concerns controlled by the 

            same socially and economically disadvantaged individual or 

            individuals which has average annual gross receipts over the 

            preceding 3 fiscal years in excess of $22,410,000, as adjusted 

            annually by the Secretary of Transportation for inflation.

                (2) Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.--

            The term ``socially and economically disadvantaged 

            individuals'' has the meaning that term has under section 8(d) 

            of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant 

            subcontracting regulations issued pursuant to that Act, except 

            that women shall be presumed to be socially and economically 

            disadvantaged individuals for purposes of this section.

        (c) Compliance With Court Orders.--Nothing in this subsection 

    limits the eligibility of an entity or person to receive funds made 

    available for any capital grant program under the jurisdiction of the 

    Federal Railroad Administration, if the entity or person is prevented, 

    in whole or in part, from complying with subsection (a) because a 

    Federal court issues a final order in which the court finds that the 

    requirement of subsection (a), or the program established under 

    subsection (a), is unconstitutional.

        (d) Program Implementation.--This section shall be carried out by 

    the Secretary and by States in a manner consistent with that by which 

    the disadvantaged business enterprises program authorized by section 

    1101(c) of this Act is carried out.

    

                  TITLE IX--HAZARDOUS MATERIAL TRANSPORTATION

    

    SEC. 9001. SHORT TITLE.

    

        This title may be cited as the ``Hazardous Material Transportation 

    Safety, Efficiency, and Accountability Act of 2012''.

    

    SEC. 9002. AMENDMENT OF TITLE 49, UNITED STATES CODE.

    

        Except as otherwise provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or 

    repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a 

    section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be 

    made to a section or other provision of title 49, United States Code.

    

    SEC. 9003. FINDINGS.

    

        Congress finds the following:

                (1) There are annually 2.2 billion tons of hazardous 

            material shipments by all modes across the United States 

            totaling more than $1.4 trillion.

                (2) The number of fatalities and serious injuries caused by 

            the transportation of hazardous material has been historically 

            low, averaging 4.2 fatalities per 100 million shipments - 

            meaning an American is about 4 times more likely to be killed 

            by lightning than a hazardous material in transportation. In 

            fiscal year 2010, there was the lowest number of hazardous 

            material incidents on record.

                (3) It is critical to the economic health of the Nation 

            that the laws and regulations governing the transportation of 

            hazardous material maintain a high level of safety, while 

            balancing the need for economic growth, innovation, 

            competitiveness, and job creation.

                (4) The individuals involved in the transportation stream 

            and the public benefit from a regulatory regime that is 

            certain, uniform, cost-efficient, and science-based.

                (5) Because of the potential risks to life, property, and 

            the environment posed by an unintentional release of hazardous 

            material, consistency and uniformity in laws and regulation 

            regarding the transportation of hazardous material is necessary 

            and desirable.

                    of movement until the hazardous material is unloaded at 

                    its destination, including during en route movement.''.

            enter into an arrangement with an objective non-profit 

            organization to conduct a peer-reviewed study of the

                       TITLE X--WATERBORNE TRANSPORTATION

    

    SEC. 10001. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON HARBOR MAINTENANCE.

    

        (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:

                (1) There are 926 ports served by federally maintained 

            channels which handle more than 2.2 billion tons of cargo 

            annually, and this figure is expected to increase.

                (2) More than $1.1 trillion in foreign commerce enters the 

            United States through the Nation's ports annually, and this 

            figure is expected to increase.

                (3) Expansion of the Panama Canal system in Central America 

            will likely be completed in 2014, and this will present 

            opportunities and challenges for the Nation's economic well-

            being.

                (4) Insufficient maintenance dredging of the Nation's 

            navigation channels results in inefficient water transportation 

            and harmful economic consequences.

                (5) In 1986, Congress created the Harbor Maintenance Trust 

            Fund to provide funds for the operation and maintenance of the 

            Nation's navigation channels.

                (6) The fiscal year 2011, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 

            equity grew by 13.7 percent from fiscal year 2010 (to $6.42 

            billion) and total annual receipts increased 17.3 percent (to 

            $1.6 billion).

                (7) Despite growth of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, 

            expenditures from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund continue to 

            decline.

                (8) Despite growth of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, 

            federally maintained channels are only at their authorized 

            widths or depths 35 percent of the time, thereby restricting 

            access to the Nation's ports for both imports and exports.

        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--

                (1) the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund is not being used for 

            its intended purpose and charging maritime commerce a harbor 

            maintenance tax while failing to provide the service for which 

            it was established is unfair and places the Nation at economic 

            risk;

                (2) the Administration should request full use of the 

            Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for operating and maintaining the 

            Nation's navigation system; and

                (3) Congress should fully expend the amounts in the Harbor 

            Maintenance Trust Fund to operate and maintain the Nation's 

            navigation system.

    

    SEC. 10002. STUDY AND REPORT ON STRATEGIC PORTS.

    

        (a) Study Requirement.--The Secretary shall conduct a study on 

    infrastructure facility requirements, road and highway improvements, 

    rail connections, and other multimodal transportation capacity 

    requirements necessary to achieve the following goals with respect to 

    strategic ports:

                (1) Provide greater access to port facilities.

                (2) Reduce congestion.

                (3) Improve the movement of goods.

                (4) Increase productivity.

                (5) Enhance maritime security.

        (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 

    this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the 

    results of the study conducted under subsection (a), with such 

    recommendations as the Secretary considers necessary to achieve the 

    goals listed in that subsection.

        (c) Strategic Port Defined.--In this section, the term ``strategic 

    port'' means a United States port designated by the Secretary and the 

    Secretary of Defense as a significant transportation hub important to 

    the readiness and cargo throughput capacity of the Department of 

    Defense.
