        Sec. 601. (a) Section 1309(a) of the National Flood Insurance Act 

    of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4016(a)) is amended by striking ``$20,725,000,000'' 

    and inserting ``$30,425,000,000''.

        (b) The amount provided by this section is designated by the 

    Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 

    251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 

    Act of 1985 and as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 4(g) of 

    the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.

        (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall be 

    considered to have taken effect on December 12, 2012.

        Sec. 602.  The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management 

    Agency, in cooperation with representatives of State, tribal, and local 

    governments may give greater weight to the factors considered under 

    section 206.48(b)(3) of title 44, Code of Federal Regulations, to 

    accurately measure the acute needs of a population following a disaster 

    in order to expedite a declaration of Individual Assistance under the 

    Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 

    U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).

        Sec. 603.  For determinations regarding compliance with codes and 

    standards under the Federal Emergency Management Agency Public 

    Assistance program (42 U.S.C. 5172), the Administrator of the Federal 

    Emergency Management Agency, for major disasters declared on or after 

    August 27, 2011, shall consider eligible the costs required to comply 

    with a State's Stream Alteration General Permit process, including any 

    design standards required to be met as a condition of permit issuance.

        Sec. 604.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 

    Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management may recommend to the 

    President an increase in the Federal cost share of the eligible cost of 

    permanent work under section 406 and of emergency work under section 

    403 and section 407 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 

    Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5172) for damages resulting from 

    Hurricane Sandy without delay.

        Sec. 605.  In administering the funds made available to address any 

    major disaster declared during the period beginning on August 27, 2011 

    and ending on December 5, 2012, the Administrator of the Federal 

    Emergency Management Agency shall establish a pilot program for the 

    relocation of State facilities under section 406 of the Robert T. 

    Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5172), 

    under which the Administrator may waive, or specify alternative 

    requirements for, any regulation the Administrator administers to 

    provide assistance, consistent with the National Environmental Policy 

    Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), for the permanent relocation of 

    State facilities, including administrative office buildings, medical 

    facilities, laboratories, and related operating infrastructure 

    (including heat, sewage, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing), that 

    were significantly damaged as a result of the major disaster, are 

    subject to flood risk, and are otherwise eligible for repair, 

    restoration, reconstruction, or replacement under section 406 of that 

    Act, if the Administrator determines that such relocation is 

    practicable, and will be cost effective or more appropriate than 

    repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing the facility in its 

    pre-disaster location, and if such relocation will effectively mitigate 

    the flood risk to the facility.

    

                                     levees

                                        (I) is participating in the 

                                    National Flood Insurance Program on the 

                                    date on which a State, local, or tribal 

                                    government submits an application 

                                    requesting to construct a permanent 

                                    flood risk reduction levee under 

                                    subsection (b); and

    Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c(b)(2)(B)), the Administrator shall 

    approve the construction of a permanent flood risk reduction levee by a 

    State, local, or tribal government on covered hazard mitigation land if 

    the Administrator and the Chief of Engineers determine, through a 

    process established by the Administrator and Chief of Engineers and 

    funded entirely by the State, local, or tribal government seeking to 

    construct the proposed levee, that--

                (1) construction of the proposed permanent flood risk 

            reduction levee would more effectively mitigate against 

            flooding risk than an open floodplain or other flood risk 

            reduction measures;

                (2) the proposed permanent flood risk reduction levee 

            complies with Federal, State, and local requirements, including 

            mitigation of adverse impacts and implementation of floodplain 

            management requirements, which shall include an evaluation of 

            whether the construction, operation, and maintenance of the 

            proposed levee would continue to meet best available industry 

            standards and practices and would be the most cost-effective 

            measure to protect against the assessed flood risk and 

            minimizes future costs to the Federal Government;

                (3) the State, local, or tribal government seeking to 

            construct the proposed levee has provided an adequate 

            maintenance plan that documents the procedures the State, 

            local, or tribal government will use to ensure that the 

            stability, height, and overall integrity of the proposed levee 

            and the structure and systems of the proposed levee are 

            maintained, including--

                        (A) specifying the maintenance activities to be 

                    performed;

                        (B) specifying the frequency with which maintenance 

                    activities will be performed;

                        (C) specifying the person responsible for 

                    performing each maintenance activity (by name or 

                    title);

                        (D) detailing the plan for financing the 

                    maintenance of the levee; and

                        (E) documenting the ability of the State, local, or 

                    tribal government to finance the maintenance of the 

                    levee.

        (c) Maintenance Certification.--

                (1) In general.--A State, local, or tribal government that 

            constructs a permanent flood risk reduction levee under 

            subsection (b) shall submit to the Administrator and the Chief 

            of Engineers an annual certification indicating whether the 

            State, local, or tribal government is in compliance with the 

            maintenance plan provided under subsection (b)(3).

                (2) Review.--The Chief of Engineers shall review a 

            certification submitted under paragraph (1) and determine 

            whether the State, local, or tribal government has complied 

            with the maintenance plan.

        Sec. 607.  The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management 

    Agency shall cancel the liquidated balances of all remaining 

    uncancelled or partially cancelled loans disbursed under the Community 

    Disaster Loan Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-88) and the Emergency 

    Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, 

    and Hurricane Recovery, 2006 (Public Law 109-234), as amended by 

    section 4502 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina 

    Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 

    110-28) to the extent that revenues of the local government during the 

    period following the major disaster are insufficient to meet the budget 

    of the local government, including additional disaster-related expenses 

    of a municipal character. In calculating a community's revenues while 

    determining cancellation, the Administrator shall exclude revenues for 

    special districts and any other revenues that are required by law to be 

    disbursed to other units of local government or used for specific 

    purposes more limited than the scope allowed by the General Fund. In 

    calculating a community's expenses, the Administrator shall include 

    disaster-related capital expenses for which the community has not been 

    reimbursed by Federal or insurance proceeds, debt service expenses, and 

    accrued but unpaid uncompensated absences (vacation and sick pay). In 

    calculating the operating deficit of the local government, the 

    Administrator shall also consider all interfund transfers. When 

    considering the period following the disaster, the Administrator may 

    consider a period of 3, 5, or 7 full fiscal years after the disaster, 

    beginning on the date of the declaration, in determining eligibility 

    for cancellation. The criteria for cancellation do not apply to those 

    loans already cancelled in full. Applicants shall submit supplemental 

    documentation in support of their applications for cancellation on or 

    before April 30, 2014, and the Administrator shall issue determinations 

    and resolve any appeals on or before April 30, 2015. Loans not 

    cancelled in full shall be repaid not later than September 30, 2035. 

    The Administrator may use funds provided under Public Law 109-88 to 

    reimburse those communities that have repaid all or a portion of loans, 

    including interest, provided as Special Community Disaster Loans under 

    Public Law 109-88 or Public Law 109-234, as amended by section 4502 of 

    Public Law 110-28. Further, the Administrator may use funds provided 

    under Public Law 109-88 for necessary expenses to carry out this 

    provision:  Provided, That the entire amount is designated by the 

    Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 

    251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 

    Act of 1985.

        Sec. 608.  The Inspector General shall review the applications for 

    public assistance provided through the Disaster Relief Fund with a 

    project cost that exceeds $10,000,000 and the resulting decisions 

    issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for category A debris 

    removal for DR-1786 upon receipt of a request from an applicant made no 

    earlier than 90 days after filing an appeal with the Federal Emergency 

    Management Agency without regard to whether the Administrator of the 

    Federal Emergency Management Agency has issued a final agency 

    determination on the application for assistance:  Provided, That not 

    later than 180 days after the date of such request, the Inspector 

    General shall determine whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency 

    correctly applied its rules and regulations to determine eligibility of 

    the applicant's claim:  Provided further, That if the Inspector General 

    finds that the Federal Emergency Management Agency determinations 

    related to eligibility and cost involved a misapplication of its rules 

    and regulations, the applicant may submit the dispute to the 

    arbitration process established under the authority granted under 

    section 601 of Public Law 111-5 not later than 15 days after the date 

    of issuance of the Inspector General's finding in the previous proviso: 

     Provided further, That if the Inspector General finds that the Federal 

    Emergency Management Agency provided unauthorized funding, that the 

    Federal Emergency Management Agency shall take corrective action.

    adjustment is due to the disaster, the Secretary may make temporary 

    adjustments to the Section 8 housing choice voucher annual renewal 

    funding allocations and administrative fee eligibility determinations 

    for public housing agencies in an area for which the President declared 

    a disaster under title IV of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 

    Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170 et seq.), to avoid significant 

    adverse funding impacts that would otherwise result from the disaster.

        Sec. 1002.  The Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban 

    Development shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the 

    House of Representatives and the Senate within 45 days after the date 

    of the enactment of this Act a plan for implementing the provisions in

        Sec. 1003.  None of the funds provided in this title to the 

    Department of Transportation or the Department of Housing and Urban 

    Development may be used to make a grant unless the Secretary of such 

    Department notifies the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations 

    and posts the notification on the public website of that agency not 

    less than 3 full business days before either Department (or a modal 

    administration of either Department) announces the selection of any

    or more.

    

                                    TITLE XI

    

                          GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS ACT

    

        Sec. 1101.  Each amount appropriated or made available in this Act 

    is in addition to amounts otherwise appropriated for the fiscal year 

    involved.

        Sec. 1102.  Each amount designated in this Act by the Congress as 

    an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the 

    Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall be 

    available only if the President subsequently so designates all such 

    amounts and transmits such designations to the Congress.

        Sec. 1103. (a) Not later than March 31, 2013, in accordance with 

    criteria to be established by the Office of Management and Budget 

    (OMB), Federal agencies shall submit to OMB and to the Committee on 

    Appropriations of the House of Representatives and of the Senate 

    internal control plans for funds provided by this Act.

    shall be deemed to be ``susceptible to significant improper payments'' 

    for purposes of the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (31 

    U.S.C. 3321 note) (IPIA), notwithstanding section 2(a) of IPIA.

        (c) In accordance with guidance to be issued by the Director of 

    OMB, agencies shall identify those grants for which the funds provided 

    by this Act should be expended by the grantees within the 24-month 

    period following the agency's obligation of funds for the grant. In the 

    case of such grants, the agency shall include a term in the grant that:

                (1) requires the grantee to return to the agency any funds 

            not expended within the 24-month period; and

                (2) provides that the head of the agency may, after 

            consultation with the Director of OMB, subsequently issue a 

            waiver of this requirement based on a determination by the head 

            of the agency that exceptional circumstances exist that justify 

            an extension of the period in which the funds must be expended.

        Sec. 1104. (a) In carrying out activities funded by this Act, 

    Federal agencies, in partnership with States, local communities and 

    tribes, shall inform plans for response, recovery, and rebuilding to 

    reduce vulnerabilities from and build long-term resiliency to future 

    extreme weather events, sea level rise, and coastal flooding. In 

    carrying out activities funded by this title that involve repairing, 

    rebuilding, or restoring infrastructure and restoring land, project 

    sponsors shall consider, where appropriate, the increased risks and 

    vulnerabilities associated with future extreme weather events, sea 

    level rise and coastal flooding.

        (b) Funds made available in this Act shall be available to develop, 

    in partnership with State, local and tribal officials, regional 

    projections and assessments of future risks and vulnerabilities to 

    extreme weather events, sea level rise and coastal flooding that may be 

    used for the planning referred to in subsection (a), and to encourage 

    coordination and facilitate long-term community resiliency.

        Sec. 1105.  Recipients of Federal funds dedicated to reconstruction 

    efforts under this Act shall, to the greatest extent practicable, 

    ensure that such reconstruction efforts maximize the utilization of 

    technologies designed to mitigate future power outages, continue 

    delivery of vital services and maintain the flow of power to facilities 

    critical to public health, safety and welfare. The Secretary of Housing 

    and Urban Development as chair of the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task 

    Force shall issue appropriate guidelines to implement this requirement.

    non-operational purposes to replace vehicles of those agencies damaged 

    by Hurricane Sandy. The Department of Justice and Department of 

    Homeland Security shall provide copies of a report summarizing the 

    actions taken to carry out this subsection to the House and Senate 

    Committees on Appropriations and Judiciary.

        (b) Funding Limitation.--No funds provided by this Act shall be 

    used to purchase, repair, or replace any Department of Justice or 

    Department of Homeland security vehicle until after the report required 

    by subsection (a) has been provided to Congress.
