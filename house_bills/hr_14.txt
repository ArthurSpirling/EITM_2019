            receive funds made available under divisions A and B of this

            entity or person is prevented, in whole or in part, from 

            complying with paragraph (2) because a Federal court issues a 

            final order in which the court finds that a requirement or the 

            implementation of paragraph (2) is unconstitutional.

                (2) Exception.--Obligation authority made available under 

            paragraph (1) shall--

                        (A) remain available for a period of 4 fiscal 

                    years; and

                        (B) be in addition to the amount of any limitation 

                    imposed on obligations for Federal-aid highway and 

                    highway safety construction programs for future fiscal 

                    years.

        (f) Redistribution of Certain Authorized Funds.--

                (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 

            distribution of obligation authority under subsection (c) for 

            each of fiscal years 2012 through 2013, the Secretary shall 

            distribute to the States any funds (excluding funds authorized 

            for the program under section 202 of title 23, United States 

            Code) that--

                    to the States (or will not be apportioned to the States 

                    under section 204 of title 23, United States Code), and 

                    will not be available for obligation, for the fiscal 

                    year because of the imposition of any obligation 

                    limitation for the fiscal year.

                (2) Ratio.--Funds shall be distributed under paragraph (1)

            authority under subsection (c)(5).

                (3) Availability.--Funds distributed to each State under 

            paragraph (1) shall be available for any purpose described in

            project--

                        (A) leverages Federal investment by encouraging 

                    non-Federal contributions to the project, including 

                    contributions from public-private partnerships;

                        (B) is able to begin construction within 18 months 

                    of being selected;

                    intelligent transportation systems, that enhance the 

                    efficiency of the project; and

                        (H) contributes to an equitable geographic 

                    distribution of funds under this section and an 

                    appropriate balance in addressing the needs of urban 

                    and rural communities.

        (f) Grant Requirements.--

                (2) Pre-approval costs.--The Secretary may allow costs 

            incurred prior to project approval to be used as a credit 

            toward the non-Federal share of the cost of the project. Such 

            costs must be adequately documented, necessary, reasonable, and 

            allocable to the current phase of the project and such costs 

            may not be included as a cost or used to meet cost-sharing or 

            matching requirements of any other federally-financed project.

        (h) Report to the Secretary.--For each project funded under this 

    section, the project sponsor shall reassess system performance and

    SEC. 1301. PROJECT DELIVERY INITIATIVE.

    

        (a) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 

    that--

                (1) it is in the national interest for the Department, 

            State departments of transportation, transit agencies, and all 

            other recipients of Federal transportation funds--

                        (A) to accelerate project delivery and reduce 

                    costs; and

                        (B) to ensure that the planning, design, 

                    engineering, construction, and financing of 

                    transportation projects is done in an efficient and 

                    effective manner, promoting accountability for public 

                    investments and encouraging greater private sector 

                    involvement in project financing and delivery while 

                    enhancing safety and protecting the environment;

                (2) delay in the delivery of transportation projects 

            increases project costs, harms the economy of the United 

            States, and impedes the travel of the people of the United 

            States and the shipment of goods for the conduct of commerce; 

            and

                (3) the Secretary shall identify and promote the deployment 

            of innovation aimed at reducing the time and money required to 

            deliver transportation projects while enhancing safety and 

            protecting the environment.

        (b) Establishment of Initiative.--

                (1) In general.--To advance the policy described in 

            subsection (a), the Secretary shall carry out a project 

            delivery initiative under this section.

                (2) Purposes.--The purposes of the project delivery 

            initiative shall be--

                        (A) to develop and advance the use of best 

                    practices to accelerate project delivery and reduce 

                    costs across all modes of transportation and expedite 

                    the deployment of technology and innovation;

                        (B) to implement provisions of law designed to 

                    accelerate project delivery; and

                        (C) to select eligible projects for applying 

                    experimental features to test innovative project 

                    delivery techniques.

                (3) Advancing the use of best practices.--

                        (A) In general.--In carrying out the initiative 

                    under this section, the Secretary shall identify and 

                    advance best practices to reduce delivery time and

                    transportation projects and programs of projects 

                    regardless of mode and project size.

                        (B) Administration.--To advance the use of best 

                    practices, the Secretary shall--

                                (i) engage interested parties, affected 

                            communities, resource agencies, and other

                            variety of means to transportation stakeholders 

                            on new innovative approaches and best 

                            practices; and

                                (iv) provide technical assistance to assist 

                            transportation stakeholders in the use of 

                            flexibility authority to resolve project delays

    Act):

                (1) Modernization of a highway by resurfacing, restoration,

        (a) In General.--When preparing a final environmental impact 

    statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 

    U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), if the lead agency makes changes in response to 

    comments that are minor and are confined to factual corrections or 

    explanations of why the comments do not warrant further agency 

    response, the lead agency may write on errata sheets attached to the 

    statement instead of rewriting the draft statement, on the condition 

    that the errata sheets--

                (1) cite the sources, authorities, or reasons that support 

            the position of the agency; and

                (2) if appropriate, indicate the circumstances that would 

            trigger agency reappraisal or further response.

        (b) Incorporation.--To the maximum extent practicable, the lead 

    agency shall expeditiously develop a single document that consists of a 

    final environmental impact statement and a record of decision unless--

                (1) the final environmental impact statement makes 

            substantial changes to the proposed action that are relevant to 

            environmental or safety concerns; or

                (2) there are significant new circumstances or information 

            relevant to environmental concerns and that bear on the 

            proposed action or the impacts of the proposed action.

    

    SEC. 1312. MEMORANDA OF AGENCY AGREEMENTS FOR EARLY COORDINATION.

    

        (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that--

                (1) the Secretary and other Federal agencies with relevant 

            jurisdiction in the environmental review process should 

            cooperate with each other and other agencies on environmental 

            review and project delivery activities at the earliest 

            practicable time to avoid delays and duplication of effort 

            later in the process, head off potential conflicts, and ensure 

            that planning and project development decisions reflect 

            environmental values; and

                (2) such cooperation should include the development of 

            policies and the designation of staff that advise planning 

            agencies or project sponsors of studies or other information 

            foreseeably required for later Federal action and early 

            consultation with appropriate State and local agencies and 

            Indian tribes.

        (b) Technical Assistance.--If requested at any time by a State or 

    local planning agency, the Secretary and other Federal agencies with 

    relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process, shall, to 

    the extent practicable and appropriate, as determined by the agencies, 

    provide technical assistance to the State or local planning agency on 

    accomplishing the early coordination activities described in subsection 

    (d).

        (c) Memorandum of Agency Agreement.--If requested at any time by a 

    State or local planning agency, the lead agency, in consultation with 

    other Federal agencies with relevant jurisdiction in the environmental 

    review process, may establish memoranda of agreement with the project 

    sponsor, State, and local governments and other appropriate entities to 

    accomplish the early coordination activities described in subsection 

    (d).

        (d) Early Coordination Activities.--Early coordination activities 

    shall include, to the maximum extent practicable, the following:

                (1) Technical assistance on identifying potential impacts 

            and mitigation issues in an integrated fashion.

                (2) The potential appropriateness of using planning 

            products and decisions in later environmental reviews.

                (3) The identification and elimination from detailed study 

            in the environmental review process of the issues that are not 

            significant or that have been covered by prior environmental 

            reviews.

                (4) The identification of other environmental review and 

            consultation requirements so that the lead and cooperating 

            agencies may prepare, as appropriate, other required analyses 

            and studies concurrently with planning activities.

                (5) The identification by agencies with jurisdiction over 

            any permits related to the project of any and all relevant 

            information that will reasonably be required for the project.

                (6) The reduction of duplication between requirements under 

            the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

            et seq.) and State and local planning and environmental review 

            requirements, unless the agencies are specifically barred from 

            doing so by applicable law.

                (7) Timelines for the completion of agency actions during 

            the planning and environmental review processes.

                (8) Other appropriate factors.

                    the lead agency, in consultation with the project

            duration stationary work zones when the project design speed is 

            anticipated to be high and the nature of the work requires

            highway construction projects, those devices are paid for on a 

            unit-pay basis, unless doing so would create a conflict with 

            innovative contracting approaches, such as design-build or some 

            performance-based contracts under which the contractor is paid

    SEC. 1531. DENALI COMMISSION.

    

        The Denali Commission Act of 1998 (42 U.S.C. 3121 note) is 

    amended--

                (1) in section 305, by striking subsection (c) and 

            inserting the following:

        ``(c) Gifts.--

                ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 

            Commission, on behalf of the United States, may accept use, and 

            dispose of gifts or donations of services, property, or money 

            for purposes of carrying out this Act.

                ``(2) Conditional.--With respect to conditional gifts--

                        ``(A)(i) the Commission, on behalf of the United 

                    States, may accept conditional gifts for purposes of 

                    carrying out this Act, if approved by the Federal

                        ``(B) no gift shall be accepted that is conditioned 

                    on any expenditure not to be funded from the gift or

                    expenditure has been approved by Act of Congress.''; 

                    and

                (2) by adding at the end the following:

    

    ``SEC. 311. TRANSFER OF FUNDS FROM OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES.

    

        ``(a) In General.--Subject to subsection (c), for purposes of this 

    Act, the Commission may accept transfers of funds from other Federal

    SEC. 1532. UPDATED CORROSION CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORT.

    

        Not later than 30 months after the date of enactment of this Act,

    SEC. 1533. HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND.

    

        (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--

                (1) there are 926 coastal, Great Lakes, and inland harbors 

            maintained by the Corps of Engineers;

                (2) according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics--

                        (A) in 2009, the ports and waterways of the United 

                    States handled more than 2,200,000,000 short tons of 

                    imports, exports, and domestic shipments; and

                        (B) in 2010, United States ports were responsible 

                    for more than $1,400,000,000,000 in waterborne imports 

                    and exports;

                (3) according to the Congressional Research Service, full 

            channel dimensions are, on average, available approximately \1/

            3\ of the time at the 59 harbors of the United States with the 

            highest use rates;

                (4) insufficient maintenance dredging of the navigation 

            channels of the United States results in inefficient water 

            transportation and causes harmful economic consequences;

                (5) in 1986, Congress created the Harbor Maintenance Trust 

            Fund to provide funds for the operation and maintenance of the 

            navigation channels of the United States;

                (6) in fiscal year 2012, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 

            is expected to grow from $6,280,000,000 to $7,011,000,000, an 

            increase of approximately 13 percent;

                (7) despite the growth of the Harbor Maintenance Trust 

            Fund, expenditures from the Fund have not equaled revenues, and 

            the Fund is not being fully used for the intended purpose of 

            the Fund; and

                (8) inadequate investment in dredging needs is restricting 

            access to the ports of the United States for domestic shipping, 

            imports, and exports and therefore threatening the economic 

            competitiveness of the United States.

        (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--

                (1) the Administration should request full use of the 

            Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for operating and maintaining the 

            navigation channels of the United States;

                (2) the amounts in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund should 

            be fully expended to operate and maintain the navigation 

            channels of the United States; and

                (3) Congress should ensure that other programs, projects, 

            and activities of the Civil Works Program of the Corps of 

            Engineers, especially those programs, projects, and activities 

            relating to inland navigation and flood control, are not 

            adversely impacted.

    

    SEC. 1534. ENRICHMENT TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

    

        (a) In addition to any other transfer authority, the Secretary may

    after Congressional notification and approval of the Committees on 

    Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate, up to 

    $150,000,000 made available in prior Appropriations Acts to further the

        (b) The Secretary shall provide, directly or indirectly, Federal 

    funds, resources, or other benefit for the research, development, or 

    deployment of domestic enrichment technology under this section--

                (1) using merit selection procedures; and

                (2) only if the Secretary shall execute an agreement with 

            the recipient (or any affiliate, successor, or assignee) of 

            such funds, resources, or other benefit (hereinafter referred 

            to as the ``recipient''), which shall require, at a minimum--

                        (A) the achievement of specific technical criteria 

                    by the recipient by specific dates no later than June 

                    30, 2014;

                        (B) that the recipient shall--

                                (i) immediately upon execution of the 

                            agreement, grant to the United States for use 

                            by or on behalf of the United States, through 

                            the Secretary, a royalty-free, non-exclusive 

                            license in all enrichment-related intellectual 

                            property and associated technical data owned, 

                            licensed or otherwise controlled by the

                        (D) whether allowing each covered truck 

                    configuration to operate would result in an increase or 

                    decrease in the total number of trucks operating on 

                    principal arterial routes and National Highway System
