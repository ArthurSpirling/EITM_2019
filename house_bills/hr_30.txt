            as public safety, grade crossing safety, hazardous materials 

            transportation safety, emergency response time, noise, and 

            socioeconomic impacts; and

                ``(7) the effect of the proposed transaction on intercity 

            rail passenger transportation and commuter rail passenger

        ``(c) The Board shall approve and authorize a transaction under 

    this section when it finds the transaction is consistent with the 

    public interest. The Board shall not approve a transaction described in 

    subsection (b) if it finds that the transaction's impacts on safety and 

    on all affected communities, as defined under subsection (b), outweigh 

    the transportation benefits of the transaction. The Board may impose 

    conditions governing a transaction under this section, including 

    conditions to mitigate the effects of the transaction on local 

    communities.'';

            Board may impose under this section include''; and

                (5) in subsection (e), as redesignated, by striking ``the 

            merger or control of at least two Class I railroads, as defined 

            by the Board'' and inserting ``a transaction described in
