                                     AN ACT

    

    

     

    To improve patient access to health care services and provide improved 

      medical care by reducing the excessive burden the liability system 

                   places on the health care delivery system.

    

        Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 

    United States of America in Congress assembled,

    

    SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    

        This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Access to Healthcare 

    Act''.

    

                              TITLE I--HEALTH ACT

    

    SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

    

        This title may be cited as the ``Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-

    cost, Timely Healthcare (HEALTH) Act of 2012''.

    

    SEC. 102. PURPOSE.

    

        It is the purpose of this title to implement reasonable, 

    comprehensive, and effective health care liability reforms designed 

    to--

                (1) improve the availability of health care services in 

            cases in which health care liability actions have been shown to 

            be a factor in the decreased availability of services;

                (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and 

            lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of which 

            contribute to the escalation of health care costs;

                (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury 

            claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including 

            reasonable noneconomic damages;

                (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our 

            current health care liability system to resolve disputes over, 

            and provide compensation for, health care liability by reducing 

            uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided to injured 

            individuals; and

                (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the 

            health care system which will reduce unintended injury and 

            improve patient care.

    

    SEC. 103. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.

    

        The time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit shall be 3 

    years after the date of manifestation of injury or 1 year after the 

    claimant discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should 

    have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall 

    the time for commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after 

    the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of the 

    following--

                (1) upon proof of fraud;

                (2) intentional concealment; or

                (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no 

            therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of 

            the injured person.

    Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of 

    the alleged manifestation of injury except that actions by a minor 

    under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 years of 

    manifestation of injury or prior to the minor's 8th birthday, whichever 

    provides a longer period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for 

    minors for any period during which a parent or guardian and a health 

    care provider or health care organization have committed fraud or 

    collusion in the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured 

    minor.

    

    SEC. 104. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.

    

        (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses in 

    Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, nothing in this 

    title shall limit a claimant's recovery of the full amount of the 

    available economic damages, notwithstanding the limitation in 

    subsection (b).

        (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--In any health care lawsuit, 

    the amount of noneconomic damages, if available, may be as much as 

    $250,000, regardless of the number of parties against whom the action 

    is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with 

    respect to the same injury.

        (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--For purposes of 

    applying the limitation in subsection (b), future noneconomic damages 

    shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not be 

    informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. An award for 

    noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall be reduced either 

    before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the judgment after 

    entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be made before accounting 

    for any other reduction in damages required by law. If separate awards 

    are rendered for past and future noneconomic damages and the combined 

    awards exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be reduced 

    first.

        (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each party shall 

    be liable for that party's several share of any damages only and not 

    for the share of any other person. Each party shall be liable only for 

    the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to 

    such party's percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of 

    liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment shall be 

    rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to such 

    party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine 

    the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant's harm.

    

    SEC. 105. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.

    

        (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to 

    Claimants.--In any health care lawsuit, the court shall supervise the 

    arrangements for payment of damages to protect against conflicts of 

    interest that may have the effect of reducing the amount of damages 

    awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In particular, in any 

    health care lawsuit in which the attorney for a party claims a 

    financial stake in the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court 

    shall have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage 

    recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the claimant 

    based upon the interests of justice and principles of equity. In no 

    event shall the total of all contingent fees for representing all 

    claimants in a health care lawsuit exceed the following limits:

                (1) Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the 

            claimant(s).

                (2) Thirty-three and one-third percent of the next $50,000 

            recovered by the claimant(s).

                (3) Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000 recovered by 

            the claimant(s).

                (4) Fifteen percent of any amount by which the recovery by 

            the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.

        (b) Applicability.--The limitations in this section shall apply 

    whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, mediation, 

    arbitration, or any other form of alternative dispute resolution. In a 

    health care lawsuit involving a minor or incompetent person, a court 

    retains the authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than 

    the maximum permitted under this section. The requirement for court 

    supervision in the first two sentences of subsection (a) applies only 

    in civil actions.

    

    SEC. 106. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

    

        (a) In General.--Punitive damages may, if otherwise permitted by 

    applicable State or Federal law, be awarded against any person in a 

    health care lawsuit only if it is proven by clear and convincing 

    evidence that such person acted with malicious intent to injure the 

    claimant, or that such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary 

    injury that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain to 

    suffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory 

    damages is rendered against such person, no punitive damages may be 

    awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit. No demand for 

    punitive damages shall be included in a health care lawsuit as 

    initially filed. A court may allow a claimant to file an amended 

    pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the claimant and 

    after a finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing 

    affidavits or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, that the 

    claimant has established by a substantial probability that the claimant 

    will prevail on the claim for punitive damages. At the request of any 

    party in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a 

    separate proceeding--

                (1) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the 

            amount of such award; and

                (2) the amount of punitive damages following a 

            determination of punitive liability.

    If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only to the 

    claim for punitive damages, as determined by applicable State law, 

    shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether 

    compensatory damages are to be awarded.

        (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--

                (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of 

            punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit, the 

            trier of fact shall consider only the following--

                        (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct 

                    of such party;

                        (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment 

                    of it by such party;

                        (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;

                        (D) the number of products sold or medical 

                    procedures rendered for compensation, as the case may 

                    be, by such party, of the kind causing the harm 

                    complained of by the claimant;

                        (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, 

                    as a result of the conduct complained of by the 

                    claimant; and

                        (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against 

                    such party as a result of the conduct complained of by 

                    the claimant.

                (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages, if 

            awarded, in a health care lawsuit may be as much as $250,000 or 

            as much as two times the amount of economic damages awarded, 

            whichever is greater. The jury shall not be informed of this 

            limitation.

        (c) No Punitive Damages for Products That Comply With FDA 

    Standards.--

                (1) In general.--

                        (A) No punitive damages may be awarded against the 

                    manufacturer or distributor of a medical product, or a 

                    supplier of any component or raw material of such 

                    medical product, based on a claim that such product 

                    caused the claimant's harm where--

                                (i)(I) such medical product was subject to 

                            premarket approval, clearance, or licensure by 

                            the Food and Drug Administration with respect 

                            to the safety of the formulation or performance 

                            of the aspect of such medical product which 

                            caused the claimant's harm or the adequacy of 

                            the packaging or labeling of such medical 

                            product; and

                                (II) such medical product was so approved, 

                            cleared, or licensed; or

                                (ii) such medical product is generally 

                            recognized among qualified experts as safe and 

                            effective pursuant to conditions established by 

                            the Food and Drug Administration and applicable 

                            Food and Drug Administration regulations, 

                            including without limitation those related to 

                            packaging and labeling, unless the Food and 

                            Drug Administration has determined that such 

                            medical product was not manufactured or 

                            distributed in substantial compliance with 

                            applicable Food and Drug Administration 

                            statutes and regulations.

                        (B) Rule of construction.--Subparagraph (A) may not 

                    be construed as establishing the obligation of the Food 

                    and Drug Administration to demonstrate affirmatively 

                    that a manufacturer, distributor, or supplier referred 

                    to in such subparagraph meets any of the conditions 

                    described in such subparagraph.

                (2) Liability of health care providers.--A health care 

            provider who prescribes, or who dispenses pursuant to a 

            prescription, a medical product approved, licensed, or cleared 

            by the Food and Drug Administration shall not be named as a 

            party to a product liability lawsuit involving such product and 

            shall not be liable to a claimant in a class action lawsuit 

            against the manufacturer, distributor, or seller of such 

            product. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a court from 

            consolidating cases involving health care providers and cases 

            involving products liability claims against the manufacturer, 

            distributor, or product seller of such medical product.

                (3) Packaging.--In a health care lawsuit for harm which is 

            alleged to relate to the adequacy of the packaging or labeling 

            of a drug which is required to have tamper-resistant packaging 

            under regulations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services 

            (including labeling regulations related to such packaging), the 

            manufacturer or product seller of the drug shall not be held 

            liable for punitive damages unless such packaging or labeling 

            is found by the trier of fact by clear and convincing evidence 

            to be substantially out of compliance with such regulations.

                (4) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any health 

            care lawsuit in which--

                        (A) a person, before or after premarket approval, 

                    clearance, or licensure of such medical product, 

                    knowingly misrepresented to or withheld from the Food 

                    and Drug Administration information that is required to 

                    be submitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 

                    Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or section 351 of the 

                    Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) that is 

                    material and is causally related to the harm which the 

                    claimant allegedly suffered;

                        (B) a person made an illegal payment to an official 

                    of the Food and Drug Administration for the purpose of 

                    either securing or maintaining approval, clearance, or 

                    licensure of such medical product; or

                        (C) the defendant caused the medical product which 

                    caused the claimant's harm to be misbranded or 

                    adulterated (as such terms are used in chapter V of the 

                    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351 et 

                    seq.)).

    

    SEC. 107. AUTHORIZATION OF PAYMENT OF FUTURE DAMAGES TO CLAIMANTS IN 

                  HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.

    

        (a) In General.--In any health care lawsuit, if an award of future 

    damages, without reduction to present value, equaling or exceeding 

    $50,000 is made against a party with sufficient insurance or other 

    assets to fund a periodic payment of such a judgment, the court shall, 

    at the request of any party, enter a judgment ordering that the future 

    damages be paid by periodic payments, in accordance with the Uniform 

    Periodic Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National 

    Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.

        (b) Applicability.--This section applies to all actions which have 

    not been first set for trial or retrial before the effective date of 

    this title.

    

    SEC. 108. DEFINITIONS.

    

        In this title:

                (1) Alternative dispute resolution system; adr.--The term 

            ``alternative dispute resolution system'' or ``ADR'' means a

            brings a health care lawsuit, including a person who asserts or

            action, and any person on whose behalf such a claim is asserted 

            or such an action is brought, whether deceased, incompetent, or 

            a minor.

            term ``compensatory damages'' includes economic damages and 

            noneconomic damages, as such terms are defined in this section.

                (4) Contingent fee.--The term ``contingent fee'' includes 

            all compensation to any person or persons which is payable only 

            if a recovery is effected on behalf of one or more claimants.

                (5) Economic damages.--The term ``economic damages'' means 

            objectively verifiable monetary losses incurred as a result of 

            the provision of, use of, or payment for (or failure to

            products, such as past and future medical expenses, loss of 

            past and future earnings, cost of obtaining domestic services, 

            loss of employment, and loss of business or employment

                (6) Health care lawsuit.--The term ``health care lawsuit'' 

            means any health care liability claim concerning the provision 

            of health care goods or services or any medical product

    SEC. 109. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.

    

        (a) Vaccine Injury.--

                (1) To the extent that title XXI of the Public Health 

            Service Act establishes a Federal rule of law applicable to a 

            civil action brought for a vaccine-related injury or death--

                        (A) this title does not affect the application of 

                    the rule of law to such an action; and

                        (B) any rule of law prescribed by this title in 

                    conflict with a rule of law of such title XXI shall not 

                    apply to such action.

                (2) If there is an aspect of a civil action brought for a 

            vaccine-related injury or death to which a Federal rule of law 

            under title XXI of the Public Health Service Act does not 

            apply, then this title or otherwise applicable law (as 

            determined under this title) will apply to such aspect of such 

            action.

        (b) Other Federal Law.--Except as provided in this section, nothing 

    in this title shall be deemed to affect any defense available to a

        (a) Health Care Lawsuits.--The provisions governing health care 

    lawsuits set forth in this title preempt, subject to subsections (b) 

    and (c), State law to the extent that State law prevents the 

    application of any provisions of law established by or under this 

    title. The provisions governing health care lawsuits set forth in this 

    title supersede chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code, to the 

    extent that such chapter--

                (1) provides for a greater amount of damages or contingent 

            fees, a longer period in which a health care lawsuit may be 

            commenced, or a reduced applicability or scope of periodic 

            payment of future damages, than provided in this title; or

                (2) prohibits the introduction of evidence regarding 

            collateral source benefits, or mandates or permits subrogation 

            or a lien on collateral source benefits.

        (b) Protection of States' Rights and Other Laws.--(1) Any issue 

    that is not governed by any provision of law established by or under 

    this title (including State standards of negligence) shall be governed 

    by otherwise applicable State or Federal law.

        (2) This title shall not preempt or supersede any State or Federal 

    law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections for 

    health care providers and health care organizations from liability, 

    loss, or damages than those provided by this title or create a cause of 

    action.

        (c) State Flexibility.--No provision of this title shall be 

    construed to preempt--

                (1) any State law (whether effective before, on, or after 

            the date of the enactment of this title) that specifies a 

            particular monetary amount of compensatory or punitive damages 

            (or the total amount of damages) that may be awarded in a 

            health care lawsuit, regardless of whether such monetary amount 

            is greater or lesser than is provided for under this title, 

            notwithstanding section 4(a); or

                (2) any defense available to a party in a health care 

            lawsuit under any other provision of State or Federal law.

    

    SEC. 111. APPLICABILITY; EFFECTIVE DATE.

    

        This title shall apply to any health care lawsuit brought in a 

    Federal or State court, or subject to an alternative dispute resolution 

    system, that is initiated on or after the date of the enactment of this 

    title, except that any health care lawsuit arising from an injury 

    occurring prior to the date of the enactment of this title shall be 

    governed by the applicable statute of limitations provisions in effect 

    at the time the injury occurred.

        (a) Amendment to McCarran-Ferguson Act.--Section 3 of the Act of 

    March 9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1013), commonly known as the McCarran-Ferguson

        ``(c) Nothing contained in this Act shall modify, impair, or 

    supersede the operation of any of the antitrust laws with respect to 

    the business of health insurance. For purposes of the preceding 

    sentence, the term `antitrust laws' has the meaning given it in 

    subsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton Act, except that 

    such term includes section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to the 

    extent that such section 5 applies to unfair methods of competition. 

    For the purposes of this subsection, the term `business of health 

    insurance' shall--

                ``(1) mean `health insurance coverage' offered by a `health 

            insurance issuer' as those terms are defined in section 9001 of 

            the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which 

            incorporates by reference and utilizes the definitions included 

            in section 9832 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 9832); 

            and

                ``(2) not include--

                        ``(A) life insurance and annuities;

                        ``(B) property or casualty insurance, including but 

                    not limited to, automobile, medical malpractice or 

                    workers' compensation insurance; or

                        ``(C) any insurance or benefits defined as 

                    `excepted benefits' under section 9832(c) of the 

                    Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 9832(c)), whether 

                    offered separately or in combination with products 

                    described in subparagraph (A).''.

        (b) Related Provision.--For purposes of section 5 of the Federal 

    Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent such section applies 

    to unfair methods of competition, section 3(c) of the McCarran-Ferguson 

    Act shall apply with respect to the business of health insurance 

    without regard to whether such business is carried on for profit, 

    notwithstanding the definition of ``Corporation'' contained in section 

    4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.

        (c) Limitation on Class Actions.--

                (1) Limitation.--No class action may be heard in a Federal 

            or State court on a claim against a person engaged in the 

            business of health insurance for a violation of any of the 

            antitrust laws (as defined in section 3(c) of the Act of March 

            9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1013), commonly known as the McCarran-

            Ferguson Act).

                (2) Exemption.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect 

            to any action commenced--

                        (A) by the United States or any State; or

                        (B) by a named claimant for an injury only to 

                    itself.

    and convincing evidence the extent to which limitation does not apply.
