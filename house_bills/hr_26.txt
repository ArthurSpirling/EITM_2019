    SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    

        It is the sense of Congress that--

                (1) the increasing rate of suicide among veterans returning 

            from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom is 

            a serious problem; and

                (2) the Secretary of Defense should conduct mandatory, 

            face-to-face and confidential mental health and traumatic brain 

            injury screenings by a licensed medical professional, for each 

            member of the Armed Forces, during the period beginning 90 days 

            after the date on which the member completes a deployment in 

            support of a contingency operation and ending 180 days after 

            such date.

    

    SEC. 3. MANDATORY, FACE-TO-FACE AND CONFIDENTIAL SCREENINGS FOR SUICIDE 

                  PREVENTION AMONG VETERANS.

    

        (a) Mandatory Screenings.--The Secretary of Defense shall carry out 

    a mandatory, face-to-face, and confidential mental health and traumatic 

    brain injury screening conducted by a licensed medical professional, 

    for each member of the Armed Forces, during the period beginning 90 

    days after the date on which the member completes a deployment in 

    support of a contingency operation and ending 180 days after such date.

        (b) Requirements of Screening.--The screenings required by 

    subsection (a) shall be designed to--

                (1) provide the members of the Armed Forces with an 

            objective mental health and traumatic brain injury standard to 

            screen for suicide risk factors;

                (2) ease the members' transitions by allowing them to be 

            honest in their assessments;

                (3) battle the stigma of depression and mental health 

            problems among service personnel and veterans; and

                (4) ultimately reduce the prevalence of suicide among 

            veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 

            Freedom.

        (c) Return to United States.--The Secretary of Defense may not 

    prohibit a member of the Armed Forces from returning to the United 

    States by reason of any result or determination made pursuant to a 

    screening conducted under subsection (a).

        (d) Requirement for Department of Defense and Department of

    Pursuant to and consistent with requirements of the Wounded Warrior Act 

    (title IV of Public Law 110-181; 10 U.S.C. 1071 note), and section 1614 

    of that Act in particular, and section 1720F of title 38, United States 

    Code, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 

    shall establish a joint protocol to share existing and future reports 

    from confidential mental health screenings conducted under this section 

    to help aid members of the Armed Forces in their transition from health 

    care and treatment provided by the Department of Defense to health care 

    and treatment provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

        (e) Contingency Operation.--For the purposes of this Act, the term 

    ``contingency operation'' has the meaning given that term under section 

    101(13) of title 10, United States Code.
